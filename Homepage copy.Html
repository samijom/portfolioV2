           <p class="about me">Hello! I am a UI designer with a passion for designing with inclusivity in mind. 
 
            I am autistic, which means that my brain works differently than most of the population. I have an eye for detail and double checking. I achieve results with accuracy and precision. 
            
            While in person I may come off as stoic & unconventional, I excel in writing. My undergrad degree in English gave me an advanced understanding in how to communicate on page.

                <h3>Research & Analytics</h3>
                <p>One of the key autistic qualities is a need for knowledge. The more I know about something the better I feel. I over research, before almost any other action. Another key autistic quality is a superior pattern recognition. This skill allows me to quickly filter all of that research into key discoveries. </p>

                <h3>Written Communication</h3>
                <p>I can weave in detail, and thematic elements into a project. I know how to tell a good story, how to craft language to expound compelling ideas.</p>
